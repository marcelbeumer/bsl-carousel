Demonstration of a fast carousel running on jQuery.

Applied strategy:
 * Walk the DOM as little and as fast as possible.
 * Don't walk the DOM after initialization.
 * Only manipulate the elements you need to manipulate to get the visuals you need.
 * Rather fast low level JavaScript than jQuery.
 * Smart bookkeeping.
